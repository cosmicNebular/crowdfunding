# Crowdfunding Pet Project
Redesign of Kickstarter with blockchain/ethereum.

******************************************************************************************************************************************************************
When people need some money for his/her career, project, or even sickness, it is hard to collect requested amount of money at a time.
So there are many online platforms that helps the person to create a campaign in order to raise money from the internet.
After participants have invested in the campaign, a final product or some report is expected.

However, in traditional crowdfunding, there exist malicious personalities, who took advantage of people's kindness,
they could get away with the money or spend it on something. There is a way to avoid such situations - using blockchain 
with created manager role.

For example, when the manager realize some money is needed to drawn, they would raise a request from the contract to some vendors and
only after enough contributors have approved this request, the money would go, so the manager is not able to spend the money without any constraint.

As a result, all work is going not through the centralized organization, but the blockchain itself. 

In the project transactions are done with help of Rinkeby Ethereum Test Network, anyone can request Ethers freely.

How to use this project. Suppose you want to launch a campaign to raise money, you create a campaign with a minimum account,
say 100,000,000,000,000 wei, (~0.0001 eth), people will start to donate money to your campaign.
You start, to say, 'oh I need to buy some material for my product', so you submit an approving request.
Once there are more than half of the contributors approving, you are ready to finalize the request, the money is sent to the factory, everyone receives your product soon.
